# Shutdown command that first closes all application windows (thus giving them a chance to save state).
# This is particularly helpful for applications like Chromium that otherwise won't shutdown cleanly.

# Schedule the shutdown to happen after closing windows (detached from terminal)
nohup bash -c "sleep 2 && systemctl poweroff --no-wall" >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# Now close all windows
./closeallwindows.sh
sleep 1 # Allow apps like Chrome to shutdown correctly
